## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mbhillrn/Bitcoin-Core-Peer-Map.git
cd Bitcoin-Core-Peer-Map

# Run the dashboard
./da.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for required dependencies (and offer to install missing ones)
2. Auto-detect your Bitcoin Core installation
3. Create a Python virtual environment
4. Launch the web dashboard on port 58333

**For detailed setup instructions, see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md).**

---

## First Run

On first run, the script automatically handles everything. Just answer `y` to the prompts and you're done.

### Step 1: Prerequisites & Virtual Environment

The script checks for required system tools and sets up an isolated Python environment:

![Prerequisites and venv setup](docs/images/2.venv-prompt.png)

Press `y` to install. If you're on Ubuntu/Debian and see a message about `python3-venv`, just press `y` again and enter your password - the script handles it.

### Step 2: Package Installation

Once approved, packages install automatically:

![Package installation](docs/images/3.install-success.png)

### Step 3: Bitcoin Core Detection

The script auto-detects your Bitcoin Core setup - this works for most common configurations and many uncommon ones too (custom paths, systemd services, non-standard datadirs):

![Bitcoin Core detection](docs/images/4.detection.png)

Press `y` to accept the detected settings. If detection fails or finds the wrong paths, press `n` to enter them manually:

![Manual configuration](docs/images/4a.manual.bitcoin.conf.entry.png)

### Step 4: Geo/IP Database Setup

On first run, you'll choose how to handle peer geolocation data:

![GeoIP Database Setup](docs/images/4c.GeoIP.First.Run.png)

- **Option 1: Enable and keep updated** (Recommended) - Downloads a shared database of known Bitcoin node locations for instant lookups. Auto-updates on each start.
- **Option 2: Enable, self-managed** - Only caches peers you discover yourself. No external database.
- **Option 3: Don't use a database** - Relies on live API lookups only (limited to 1 lookup per 1.5 seconds).

If you choose Option 1, the database downloads in seconds:

![GeoIP Database Download](docs/images/4d.GeoIP.dbdl.png)

### Recovering from Incomplete Installation

If a previous installation was interrupted, the script detects this and offers to reset:

```
MBCore Dashboard virtual environment needs to be reset

We found an existing MBCore Dashboard virtual environment, but it appears
to be incomplete (possibly from a previous installation that didn't finish).

This only affects the ./venv folder inside this project directory.
Your other Python environments are not affected.

? Reset the MBCore Dashboard virtual environment? [y/N] y
```

After setup completes, you'll see the main menu.

---

## How To Access The Dashboard

When you select `1) Enter MBCore Dashboard` from the main menu, you'll see this screen:

![Dashboard Launch](docs/images/10.dashboard-launch.png)

The dashboard runs as a local web server. Open the URL in any browser to access it.

### From the Same Machine

Use either address - both work:
- `http://127.0.0.1:58333` (localhost)
- `http://[your-lan-ip]:58333` (shown on screen)

On GUI machines with a desktop, the browser opens automatically.

### From Another Computer on Your Network

Use the LAN IP shown on the dashboard launch screen:
```
http://192.168.x.x:58333
```

Your actual IP will be displayed. If it won't connect, your firewall may be blocking port 58333 - see [Firewall Configuration](#firewall-configuration).

### From Outside Your Network (SSH Tunnel)

If you're accessing a remote/headless machine:

1. From your local computer, SSH with port forwarding:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 58333:127.0.0.1:58333 user@remote-machine
   ```

2. Start the dashboard on the remote machine via that SSH session

3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:58333` in your local browser

The tunnel forwards your local port to the remote machine. No firewall changes needed.

---

### Quick Reference

| Situation | How to Access |
|-----------|---------------|
| Full GUI machine | Run `./da.sh` → browser auto-opens to `http://127.0.0.1:58333` |
| Headless + LAN access | Run `./da.sh` → note IP shown on screen → browse to `http://[that-ip]:58333` from any device on your network |
| Headless + SSH tunnel | `ssh -L 58333:127.0.0.1:58333 user@host` → run `./da.sh` → browse to `http://127.0.0.1:58333` on your local machine |

---

## Firewall Configuration

**The dashboard includes a built-in Firewall Helper!** From the main menu, select `3) Firewall Helper`:

![Firewall Helper](docs/images/6.firewall-helper.png)

The Firewall Helper automatically:
- Detects your IP address and subnet
- Checks if UFW or firewalld is active
- Shows your current firewall rules for the dashboard port
- Provides ready-to-use commands to reverse any changes

**Using a different port?** Use `p) Port Settings` from the main menu to change the dashboard port before running the Firewall Helper. The helper will automatically use your configured port.

### Manual Firewall Commands (Ubuntu/Mint/Debian with UFW)

```bash
# Option 1: Allow only your local network (recommended)
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 58333 proto tcp

# Option 2: Allow from anywhere on the machine
sudo ufw allow 58333/tcp
```

Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your actual subnet (the Firewall Helper will detect this for you).

### To Remove the Firewall Rule Later

```bash
# If you used Option 1:
sudo ufw delete allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 58333 proto tcp

# If you used Option 2:
sudo ufw delete allow 58333/tcp
```

### No Firewall?

If you don't have a firewall enabled (or UFW is inactive), the dashboard should work without any configuration.

## Dependencies

All dependencies are automatically detected on startup. If anything is missing, you'll be offered the option to install it.

### System Tools (Required)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jq` | JSON parser for RPC responses |
| `curl` | HTTP client for API calls |
| `sqlite3` | Database for caching peer geo-location data |
| `python3` | Python interpreter (3.8+) |
| `vmstat` | System statistics for CPU monitoring |
| `awk` | Text processing for system stats |

### Bitcoin Core

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bitcoin-cli` | RPC interface to communicate with bitcoind |
| `bitcoind` | Bitcoin Core daemon (must be running) |

### Python Packages

These are installed automatically into a local virtual environment (`./venv/`).

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `fastapi` | FastAPI web framework |
| `uvicorn` | ASGI server for FastAPI |
| `jinja2` | Template engine for FastAPI |
| `sse-starlette` | Server-Sent Events for real-time updates |

## How It Works

### Bitcoin Core Detection

On first run, MBCore Dashboard automatically detects your Bitcoin Core setup:

1. **Process Detection** - Checks if `bitcoind` is running and extracts `-datadir` and `-conf` from process arguments
2. **Systemd Detection** - If bitcoind isn't running, checks systemd service configurations
3. **Config File Search** - Looks in common locations (`~/.bitcoin/`, `/etc/bitcoin/`, etc.)
4. **Data Directory Search** - Locates the blockchain data directory
5. **Authentication** - Finds cookie auth file or reads RPC credentials from config
6. **RPC Test** - Verifies connection to Bitcoin Core

All detected settings are saved locally for fast startup on subsequent runs.

### Geo-Location

- Uses ip-api.com (free tier, no API key required)
- Rate limited to 45 requests/minute (script uses 1.5s delay between calls)
- Private networks (Tor, I2P, CJDNS) are marked as "Private Location"
- Failed lookups retry with exponential backoff: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, then weekly

### Database

**Geo/IP Database** (`./data/geo.db`):
- Caches full API responses from ip-api.com to minimize API calls
- Stores: geographic location, ISP, AS info, timezone, currency, and more
- Shared across sessions - data persists even after restart
- Optionally downloads from the [Bitcoin Node GeoIP Dataset](https://github.com/mbhillrn/Bitcoin-Node-GeoIP-Dataset) for instant lookups
- Check integrity, reset, and configure from the main menu (**g) Geo/IP Database**)
- First-run prompts you to enable/disable database caching

## Main Menu Options

![Main Menu](docs/images/5.main-menu.png)

1. **Enter MBCore Web Dashboard** - Launch the web-based dashboard with interactive map
2. **Reset MBCore Config** - Clear saved Bitcoin Core configuration
3. **Firewall Helper** - Configure firewall for network access

Additional options:
- **g) Geo/IP Database** - Manage the geo-location cache database (integrity check, reset, advanced options)
- **d) Rerun Detection** - Re-detect Bitcoin Core settings
- **m) Manual Settings** - Manually enter Bitcoin Core paths
- **p) Port Settings** - Change the dashboard port (default: 58333). Useful if port 58333 is in use or you prefer a different port. This setting persists across reboots and updates.
- **u) Update** - Update to the latest version (shown when an update is available)

### Port Settings

![Port Settings](docs/images/9.port-settings.png)

Change the dashboard port if 58333 conflicts with another service or you prefer a different port. The setting persists across restarts and updates.

### Auto-Update

When a new version is available, you'll see the update prompt:

![Auto Update](docs/images/8.Auto.Update.png)

Press `y` to update - your configuration and database are preserved.

### Geo/IP Database Settings

Access advanced database options from the main menu with `g`:

![Geo/IP Database Settings](docs/images/7.geo-database.png)

## Usage Tips

**Pro tip:** Hover over labels and values throughout the dashboard - many elements reveal additional details in tooltips.

### Refresh Rate

![Settings Dropdown](docs/images/17.settings-dropdown.png)

The peer update frequency can be adjusted in the settings dropdown (gear icon in the header). Enter any number of seconds (default: 10).

![Currency Settings](docs/images/17a.Currency-menu.png)

Bitcoin price has its own settings - click the currency label (USD, EUR, etc.) to change currency or adjust the price update interval.

**Recommendation:** 10 seconds provides a good balance between responsiveness and resource usage.

### Map Features

#### Map Display Modes

![Map Modes](docs/images/11.map-modes.png)

Choose how the map displays:
- **Normal** - Standard finite world map
- **Wrap + Points** - World wraps with ghost markers at edges

- **Duration** - How long connected (e.g., 7d3h)

#### Private Networks (Antarctica)

![Antarctica](docs/images/14.antarctica.png)

Peers using private networks (Tor, I2P, CJDNS) don't have real geographic coordinates. These peers are displayed along the northern coast of Antarctica for visualization. The popup shows "(Location Private) - Shown in Antarctica for display only."

![Show/Hide Antarctica Toggle](docs/images/25.show.hide.penguin.png)

Toggle Antarctica dots on/off using the "Hide"/"Show" link in the map legend, right next to the penguin!

### Peer Table

![Peer Table](docs/images/24.peer.table.list.png)

The peer table shows all connected peers with live data. The header displays network counts with delta indicators (+1, -2) as peers connect and disconnect.

**Default columns:** ID, Net, Duration, Type, IP, Port, Node ver/name, Service, City, State/Region, Country, Continent, ISP, Ping, Sent, Received, In Addrman?

#### Network Filters

### Peer Management

The dashboard provides tools to manage peer connections directly.

#### Connect to Peer

![Connect Peer](docs/images/20.connect-peer.png)

Click **Connect Peer** to manually connect to a peer. The modal shows examples for every protocol:

- **IPv4:** `192.168.1.10` (port 8333 used if omitted)
- **IPv6:** `[2001:db8::1]` (port 8333 used if omitted)
- **Tor:** `abc...xyz.onion` (port 8333 used if omitted)
- **CJDNS:** `[fc00::1]` (passed as-is)
- **I2P:** `abc...xyz.b32.i2p:0` (port :0 is required)

As you type an address, the modal automatically generates:
- A **bitcoin-cli addnode** command with your detected datadir and conf paths - copy and paste to add the peer permanently via terminal
- An **addnode=** line to paste directly into your bitcoin.conf file

#### Disconnect Peer

![Disconnect Peer](docs/images/22.disconnect.button.menu.png)

Click **Disconnect Peer** to open the management menu:

1. Enter the **Peer ID** (shown in the ID column of the peer table)
2. Optionally check **Ban IP for 24 hours**
3. Click **Disconnect**

**Note:** Banning only works for IPv4 and IPv6 peers. Tor, I2P, and CJDNS peers don't have bannable IP identities in Bitcoin Core.

#### Manage Bans

From the Disconnect Peer menu:

- **List Banned IPs** - View all banned IPs with expiry times and individual unban buttons
- **Clear All Bans** - Remove all IP bans at once

### Geo/IP Database (Dashboard)

![Geo/IP Database Modal](docs/images/21.geo.ip.database.modal.png)

Click **MBCore DB** in the sidebar to view database details:

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't load from another computer
- Use the **Firewall Helper** from the main menu (`f` key) for easy setup
- Or manually ensure your firewall allows port 58333 (see [Firewall Configuration](#firewall-configuration) above)

### Dashboard won't load at all
- Close any browser tabs from previous dashboard sessions
- Check if port 58333 is in use: `ss -tlnp | grep 58333`

### Bitcoin Core not detected
- Make sure `bitcoind` is running
- Try the manual settings option from the main menu

### Geo-location showing "Unknown"
- The API is throttled to one every 1.5 seconds, which is reasonably fast. "Stalking..." means that it is still finding the location of that peer.
- Check your internet connection
