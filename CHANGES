v7.6.1 — Refined Private Network Mode interactions: mini donut segments now hover-preview and click-enter specific networks, donut selection persists through map refreshes, and clicking blank map space progressively deselects. Panel row hover previews lines to grouped peers, sub-tooltip peer hover previews individual connections, and flight deck chips correctly route to the right network panel.

v7.6.0 — New Private Network Mode for Tor, I2P, and CJDNS peers with dedicated donut visualization, overview panel, and Antarctica map zoom. Flight deck network chips now toggle between public and private modes. Collapsible AS legend keeps the right-side layout clean.

v7.5.4 — Added network badge, resize handle, and 20 new getpeerinfo fields to the peer detail popup. Rewrote README opening and added full peer popup documentation with new screenshot.

v7.5.3 — Fixed donut chart not updating immediately when clicking category rows or toggling connection grid items. Others popup now stays open when selecting a sub-provider for easy switching, with proper map line restoration on hover.

v7.5.2 — Fixed ISP panel scroll reset on data refresh, replaced oval donut morph with a floating popup for Others sub-providers, and fixed broken drill-down interactivity for all Others provider panels. Added "← Others" back navigation in the donut center and service flag descriptions to the Summary panel tooltips.

v7.5.1 — Fixed peer focus being lost on auto-refresh: clicking a map dot now correctly stays zoomed and focused on the selected peer through data update cycles instead of resetting to show all lines. Summary and provider panels now scroll back to the top when reopened.

v7.5.0 — Complete overhaul of peer selection, zoom, and panel interaction behavior. Clicking any peer (map dot, multi-peer group, or table row) now consistently zooms to the peer, opens the detail popup, draws a single connection line, and persists through 10-second data refreshes. Fixed hover-preview vs click-select state separation so hovering other items previews them without losing the active selection.
